# SimplePrefs

--DESCRIPTION

Asset for Unity.Simplifies working with PlayerPrefs. You no longer need to monitor the life cycle of PlayerPrefs, you do not need to create and store constants to access PlayersPrefs.This asset will do everything for you.

--HOW IT WORKS

 When the game starts, variables marked with the [PrefsSaver] or [PrefsSaver (obj)] attribute will be automatically initialized with the saved values. When the game is turned off, the variables will be saved in PlayersPrefs automatically.
